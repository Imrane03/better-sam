# SAM Software Automatic Mouth

## What is SAM?

Sam is a very small Text-To-Speech (TTS) program written in C, that
runs on most popular platforms.

It is an adaption to Javascript of the speech software SAM (Software
Automatic Mouth) for the Commodore C64 published in the year 1982 by
Don't Ask Software (now SoftVoice, Inc.).

It is based on the adaption to C by
[Stefan Macke](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM)
and the refactorings by 
[Vidar Hokstad](https://github.com/vidarh/SAM) and
[8BitPimp](https://github.com/8BitPimp/SAM)

It includes a Text-To-Phoneme converter called reciter and a
Phoneme-To-Speech routine for the final output.

It aims for low memory impact and file size which is the reason I want
to avoid the 
[Emscripten conversion](http://simulationcorner.net/index.php?page=sam)
by Stefan (which weights about 414kb).

## Usage

Require the module via yarn: `yarn add sam-js`

Use it in your program:

```javascript
import SamJs from 'sam-js';

let sam = new SamJs();

// Play "Hello world" over the speaker.
// This returns a Promise resolving after playback has finished.
sam.speak('Hello world');

// Generate a wave file containing "Hello world" and download it.
sam.download('Hello world');

// Render the passed text as 8bit wave buffer array (Uint8Array).
const buf8 = sam.buf8('Hello world');

// Render the passed text as 32bit wave buffer array (Float32Array).
const buf32 = sam.buf32('Hello world');
```

## Original docs.

I have bundled a copy of the original manual in this repository, see
the [manual](docs/manual.md) file in the [docs](docs) directory.

## License

The software is a reverse-engineered version of a commercial software
published more than 30 years ago. The current copyright holder is 
SoftVoice, Inc. (www.text2speech.com)

Any attempt to contact the company failed. The website was last
updated in the year 2009. The status of the original
software can therefore best described as Abandonware
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware)

As long this is the case I cannot put my code under any specific open
source software license Use it at your own risk.
